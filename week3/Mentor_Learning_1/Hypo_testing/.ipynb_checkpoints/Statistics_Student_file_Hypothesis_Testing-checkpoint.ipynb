    "Q1. Tom is working in a credit card processing company as a team leader. His team is responsible to validate certain data for new credit card applications. The time spent by his team on an application is normally distributed with average 300 minutes and standard deviation 40 minutes.Tom and his team worked on process improvement to reduce the time spent in processing new applications. After implementing the improvements, Tom checked the time spent by his team on randomly selected 25 new card applications. The average time spent is 290 min. Tom is happy that, though it is a small improvement, it is a step in right direction. He shares the good news with his manager Lisa. But Lisa in not convinced about the improvement. At 95% confidence, is the processes really improved?"

    "Q2.The Titan Insurance Company has just installed a new incentive payment scheme for its life policy sales-force. It wants to have an early view of the success or failure of the new scheme. Indications are that the sales force is selling more policies but sales always vary in an unpredictable pattern from month to month and it is not clear that the scheme has made a significant difference. Life Insurance companies typically measure the monthly output of a salesperson as the total sum assured for the policies sold by that person during the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Titan's new scheme is that the sales force receive low regular salaries but are paid large bonuses related to their output (i.e. to the total sum assured of policies sold by them). The scheme is expensive for the company but they are looking for sales increases to compensate for it. The scheme has now been in operation for four months. It has settled down after fluctuations in the first two months due to the changeover.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the effectiveness of the scheme, Titan has taken a random sample of 30 salespeople measured their output in the penultimate month prior to changeover and then measured it in the fourth month after the changeover (they have deliberately chosen months not too close to the changeover)."
